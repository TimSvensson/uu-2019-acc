**** Computing and its Role in the Internet of Things (p13-bonomi.pdf)
    
    The article argues that a new compute paradigm should be created, called Fog
    Computing, that shall solve issues that currently are present in Cloud
    Computing. The Fog shall provide localized, geographically aware,
    low-latency networking for devices that require such things.

    In short, the Fog will be a low-latency layer between a end-user, or device,
    and the cloud.

**** MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (googlemapreduce.pdf)
